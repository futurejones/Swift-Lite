### What is Swift-Lite?
Swift-Lite is a super lean version of Swift built for small arm SBC's like the Raspberry Pi running the Debian based Linux OS Raspbian. Swift-Lite uses meta-tags combined with a special build utility to make constructing a multi-file Swift project with Module and Library dependancies simple and easy. Swift Modules can be used in much the same way you would use a Framework or a Library.

Swift-Lite is built from the official repo on Swift.org. It includes Foundation, Dispatch and all the main core libraries of Swift.  
Not included are the Swift add-ons such as Package Manager, REPL, LLDB and XCTest.  
This results in a greatly reduced download and install size from 140MB/725MB to 44MB/240MB but without reducing or compromising the core functionality of the Swift language.

### Swift-Lite Raspberry Pi Edition
Swift-Lite Raspberry Pi Edition is a special Swift-Lite universal install for all Raspberry Pi models running Raspbian Stretch. Swift-Lite RPE includes the GPIO library so you can access and control the RPi GPIO pins without having to install any additional software.
Simply add `import GPIO` to your Swift project file.  
Swift-Lite RPE is cross compatible over all Raspberry Pi models. This means that a Swift executable that is built on the Raspberry Pi 3 will work on the Raspberry Pi Zero/A+/2 etc including GPIO support.

### Sample Project, Module and Library files for Swift-Lite

#### Projects
* Helloworld
* Flash LED Basic
* Flash LED using Timers
* HC-SR04 Ultrasonics Distance Measurement

#### Modules
* Date - Returns the current date in full style
* Time - Uses DispatchTime to insert wait time - Usage similar to usleep/sleep
* Command - Run terminal shell commands

#### [Getting Started with Modules](/docs/using-modules.md)

#### Libraries
* GPIO - Access and control the GPIO pins - Features auto board type detect for all Raspberry Pi's

### What is swift-lite-build
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift%20Lite%20Build-Linux-green.svg" />

`swift-lite-build` is a build utility that scans the swift project file for module and library dependencies and creates a custom swift build command to build the project. `swift-lite-build` does this by scanning the included meta tags and import statements in the swift project file.  
`swift-lite-build` can be installed and used on any system or platform that has Swift installed on it.  
To use simply type `swift-lite-build` followed by the `project file name`.  
````
swift-lite-build helloWorld.swift
````

#### The Project File
To use a project file with swift-lite-build add the following meta tags.

``` 
// name:helloworld
// type:project
// include:numbers.swift
// include:date.swift
```

#### The Module File
To use a module file with swift-lite-build add the following meta tags.

``` 
// name:numbers
// type:module
```

#### File Location
 - Project files can be located in any directory located in the `/home/user/` directory.
 - Module files must be located in a directory named `swiftModules`. `swiftModules` can be located in any directory located in the `/home/user/` directory. 
 
NOTE: There must only be one "swiftModules" directory.

#### 3rd Party Libraries
`swift-lite-build` also allows you to auto add pre-built swift libraries such as the GPIO libraries.
Swift libraries are added to the default `/usr/lib` directory and can be used in a project by adding an "import" statement.
```
import GPIO
```
